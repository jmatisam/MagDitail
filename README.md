# Project: Magic Detail Shop!
## Welcome to crazy products, don't stop buying today if you were going to buy it tomorrow.


 What do we sell? At Random Shop we bet on chaos as a hallmark. When someone comes to our store we want them to feel completely lost, and not know what they are going to buy (or how much they are going to pay for it). Today, our stock consists of pets, gourmet products, Magic cards and footwear (outlet).

Our previous programmer, Mariano, has left the company to set up his own startup selling motorcycles using blockchain. Luckily, we have been able to hire you to continue working on our sales system.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
